TFTP does not have a method to list the contents of a directory, so your TFTP server will
add this capability without the need to modify the communication protocol. Since the
question mark is an invalid filename character in most file systems, it will be used to
request the listing of the directory. Any request to read a filename that starts with a
question mark will result in the directory listing being returned. A filename of “?” will
return the listing for the root directory of the TFTP server. The format of the listing
should be as follows: one file or directory name per line. File lines should have the
filename terminated with a ‘|’ character; this should be followed by the size of the file in
decimal. Directory lines should terminate the directory name with ‘/’ character. The
ordering of the filenames in the listing is unspecified.
